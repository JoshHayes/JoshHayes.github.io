title: About
---

I am a Quantitative Analyst on the interest rates and credit team at Fairtree. Most of my time is spent on research related to interest-rates, credit, volatility, as well as systematic strategies for trading, risk management, and portfolio optimization. Previously, I worked at Deloitte and before that interned at various financial institutions in South Africa.

I obtained my Master's in Mathematical Finance with distinction from the African Institute of Financial Markets and Risk Management (AIFMRM) at the University of Cape Town. My prior education was in mathematics and philosophy at the same university.
