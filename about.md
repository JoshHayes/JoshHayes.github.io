I am a Quantitative Analyst on the interest rates and credit team at Fairtree. Most of my time is spent on research related to interest rates, credit, volatility, as well as systematic strategies for trading, risk management, and portfolio optimization.

*Education*: Master of Philosophy specialising in Mathematical Finance with distinction from the [African Institute of Financial Markets and Risk Management (AIFMRM)](https://commerce.uct.ac.za/aifmrm/master-financial-engineering) at the University of Cape Town. Previously, I studied mathematics and philosophy at the same university.
