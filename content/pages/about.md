I am a Quantitative Analyst on the interest rates and credit team at Fairtree.
Most of my time is spent on research related to interest rates, credit,
volatility, as well as systematic strategies for trading, risk management, and
portfolio optimisation.

$$J(f) = \int_\mathbb{R} f(x) \mathrm{d}\mu(x)$$

distinction from the African Institute of Financial Markets and Risk Management
